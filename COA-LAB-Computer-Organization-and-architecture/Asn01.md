## CO Lab Assignment-1

### Objectives:
To gain an understanding of the functioning of an ALU inside a processor by fabricating it in a logic simulator environment and experimenting with it.

### Exercises:
Fabricate a simple 4-bit ALU capable of performing the two operations: arithmetic addition and logical AND as shown in the diagram below in a logic simulator environment.  
Apply all combinations of inputs and the commands as indicated in the table below and record the observed corresponding outputs.

### Details of work:
(include screenshots of the circuit diagram that you designed on the simulator and describe the details in your own words.)
